# 🚀 3D T-Shirt Customization Project

This is a **modern and interactive web application** for customizing 3D T-shirts using **Three.js**. Users can add their own text to a virtual T-shirt in real time and visualize the result interactively.

## ✨ Features
✅ **3D T-shirt Model** - Load and render 3D models dynamically  
✅ **Interactive Customization** - Users can input text and see it applied to the T-shirt  
✅ **Decal Geometry** - Uses DecalGeometry to place text precisely on the 3D surface  
✅ **OrbitControls Support** - Allows rotating, zooming, and inspecting the model  
✅ **GLTFLoader Support** - Loads GLTF models efficiently  
✅ **Fast Performance** - Optimized rendering and texture application  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Frontend | 3D Rendering | Utilities |

| HTML | Three.js | Tailwind CSS |
| CSS | DecalGeometry | OrbitControls |
| JavaScript | GLTFLoader | - |

## 🚀 Installation & Usage
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oguzhandemirkaya/tshirt.git
cd 3d-tshirt-customizer
```

### 2️⃣ **Run a Local Server**
Since Three.js requires a local server to load models, you can use a simple HTTP server:
```bash
npx live-server
# or if using Python
python -m http.server 8080
```
Then, open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

## 👨‍💻 About
This project was created to explore **3D customization in web applications** using **Three.js** and **DecalGeometry**. It demonstrates how users can apply personalized text onto 3D models dynamically.
